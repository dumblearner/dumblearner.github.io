<h2>Other Activities</h2>
<p>

<ul>
<li> I have been involved with the web magazine <a href="https://gonitsora.com/">Gonit Sora</a> almost since its creation and am currently an editor. The website was started about a decade ago by <a href="https://manjilsaikia.in/">Manjil Pratim Saikia</a> and <a href="https://pankajjyoti.com/">Pankaj Jyoti Mahanta</a> while they were both students at Tezpur University. We are bilingual, Manjil handles the English version and Pankaj handles the <a href="https://as.gonitsora.com/">Assamese Version</a>.


<li> Since June 2021, I have been a student of <a href="https://www.darbar.org/academy">Darbar Academy</a> and have been learning how to sing in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_classical_music">Hindustani Classical tradition</a> under the guidance of <a href="http://www.indranimukherjee.com/">Indrani Mukherjee</a>.

<li> I have volunteered for <a href="https://www.londonmaths.org/">London Maths Outreach</a>.

<li> I was a postgraduate research student representative of my department between September 2020 and May 2022.

<li> I was an organiser for the conference <a href="https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahwas/ecrm/">Early Career Researchers in Mathematics 2022</a>. 


</ul>
</p>
<p>
Other than the above activities, I also play strategy/simulation single-player video games. Recently, I have been playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorio/">Factorio</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_Not_Included">Oxygen Not Included</a>. I also spend a good amount of my time in cooking, reading (or listening to) books, watching Anime and going on long walks.
