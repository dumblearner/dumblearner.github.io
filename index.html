<h2>Hello and Welcome to my Webpage</h2>
<p>
I am a PhD student in the Mathematics department of University College London (2019 onwards). My supervisor is <a href="https://physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/index.html">Alan Sokal</a>. 
(<a href="./images/Alan_and_I.jpeg">Here is a picture with Alan during a lake district hike.</a>)
I am currently on the job market looking for a postdoctoral position.</p>
<p>My primary interest is in enumerative combinatorics. I try to exactly enumerate combinatorial families of objects. I love bijective method of proofs and proof without words.</p>
<p>My PhD research is primarily on total positivity (total non-negativity in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totally_positive_matrix">Wikipedia</a> definition).<br>
<p>
My pronouns are he/him.
</p>
<p>
You can contact me at "bishal dot deb dot nineteen at ucl dot ac dot uk". More detailed contact information has been provided in the <a href="./contact.html">Contact</a> page.
</p>

<p>
I believe in the axioms of <a href="http://math.sfsu.edu/federico/">Federico Ardila</a>:
<p>
Axiom 1. Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
</p>
<p>
Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
</p>
<p>
Axiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
</p>
<p>
Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
