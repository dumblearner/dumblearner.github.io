<h2>Past Education</h2>
<p>

I did my schooling in Assam, first from Carmel School, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digboi">Digboi</a> till class 10, and then from <a href="https://saltbrookacademy.com/">Salt Brook Academy, Dibrugarh</a> till class 12.
</p>
<p>
I then moved to Chennai for my higher education and enrolled at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Mathematical_Institute">Chennai Mathematical Institute</a>. I finished a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science in 2017. I joined for a masters programme in computer science but left the institute after finishing my first year of masters in 2018.
</p>
<p>
During my time in CMI, I attended two out of four courses offered by <a href="http://xavierviennot.org/xavier/Bienvenue.html">Prof. Xavier Viennot</a> at the <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in/">Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai</a>. The courses were offered between 2016-2019, one course each year. The lectures have been recorded and uploaded on YouTube. The links can be found on his <a href="http://viennot.org/">website</a>. He has arranged it in the form of a video book, where each lecture has been divided into sections and each of their timestamped links from the YouTube video have been linked. The slides are also available.

</p>


<p>
I moved to Paris and joined <a href="http://www.u-pem.fr/">Université Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée</a> (now Université Gustave Eiffel). I obtained a Master 2 degree in Computer Science in Informatique Fondamentale track (2019). My M2 was funded by <a href="http://labex-bezout.fr/masters-scholarships/">Labex Bezout</a>. The track Informatique Fondamentale had courses in both mathematics and computer science. 
</p>
<p>
I did my masters thesis in enumerative combinatorics under the supervision of <a href="https://igm.univ-mlv.fr/~giraudo/">Samuele Giraudo</a> and <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~josuat/">Matthieu Josuat-Vergès</a>. My thesis can be found <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahbde/index-Files/DEB_Bishal_M2_MI_rapport_stage_2018-2019.pdf">here</a>. The primary object of study were Stammering Tableaux which were introduced in <a href="https://dmtcs.episciences.org/3930/pdf">this</a> paper.<br>
